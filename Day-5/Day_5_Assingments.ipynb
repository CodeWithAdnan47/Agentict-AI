        "\n",
        "📝 Input Paragraph: Over the past decade, education has experienced a significant shift due to rapid advancements in technology. Online learning platforms like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy have made high-quality education accessible to millions of students worldwide. Virtual classrooms now allow real-time interaction between teachers and learners, breaking down geographical barriers. Artificial intelligence is further enhancing the learning experience through personalized tutoring, automated grading, and adaptive content delivery based on student performance. This shift has empowered students to learn at their own pace, revisit lectures, and explore diverse topics beyond their curriculum. Mobile apps and gamified learning modules are keeping learners engaged in innovative ways. However, this digital transformation also introduces challenges. Not all students have equal access to stable internet, quality devices, or a quiet learning environment at home. Additionally, the lack of face-to-face interaction may lead to feelings of isolation and reduced motivation. As we embrace the future of education, balancing technology with human support and inclusivity remains critical.\n",

            "*   **Overweight:** A BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 indicates you are in the overweight category. This means you might be carrying more weight than is considered ideal for your height. While not as high a risk as obesity, it's a good time to be mindful of your health habits.\n",
            "*   **Obese:** A BMI of 30.0 or higher means you are in the obese category. This is associated with a significantly increased risk of various health issues.\n",

For example, a very muscular person might have a higher BMI but be perfectly healthy. It's always a good idea to talk to a doctor or a registered dietitian for personalized health advice.\n"
