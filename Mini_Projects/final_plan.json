Continue with your exercise routine, incorporating a mix of cardio and strength training for optimal fat loss and muscle preservation.\n9.  **Sleep:** Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is vital for hormone regulation, including hormones that control appetite and fat storage.\n10. **Mindful Eating:** Eat slowly, savor your food, and avoid distractions during meals. This can help you recognize fullness cues better.\n\nThis plan provides a solid foundation.

Modify movements as needed to suit your current fitness level.\n*   **Progression:** As you get fitter, you can increase the weight of your dumbbells, add more reps, increase the duration of your planks, or reduce your rest periods slightly. You can also increase the number of circuits to 4 or 5.\n*   **Cardio Variety:** Consider adding other forms of cardio like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming on your non-strength training days to further boost calorie expenditure.\n\nThis plan is a solid foundation.
