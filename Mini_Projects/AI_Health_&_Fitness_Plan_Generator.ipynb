            "2.  **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how you feel after meals. If certain foods cause discomfort, swap them out.\n",
            "3.  **Meal Timing:** While the specific meal timing isn't as critical as total daily intake for fat loss, consistency can help regulate hunger and energy levels.\n",
            "4.  **Fiber:** This plan is rich in fiber from oats, lentils, quinoa, fruits, vegetables, and seeds. Fiber is essential for digestion, satiety, and blood sugar control, all important for fat loss.\n",
            "5.  **Healthy Fats:** The fats in this plan come from sources like nuts, seeds, and olive oil, which are beneficial for hormone production and satiety.\n",

            "7.  **Progress Monitoring:** Track your weight and body measurements weekly. If you're not seeing progress after 2-3 weeks, you may need to slightly reduce your calorie intake (by about 100-200 calories) or increase your activity level.\n",
            "8.  **Exercise:** This plan is designed to complement moderate activity. Continue with your exercise routine, incorporating a mix of cardio and strength training for optimal fat loss and muscle preservation.\n",
            "9.  **Sleep:** Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) is vital for hormone regulation, including hormones that control appetite and fat storage.\n",
